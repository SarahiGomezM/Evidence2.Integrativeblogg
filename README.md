According to the topics covered in class, I consider that statistical analysis for decision making is a valuable tool to provide us with key information to improve efficiency and analyze every aspect within the data we have.

One of the things that I found most interesting and caught my attention were the possible tools to use to analyze the data efficiently. During the class, we used Colab, where we saw examples of the type of linear programming, forecasts for decision making and how they consist of estimates according to the situation that is presented.

Another of the most outstanding features is the fact that it requires accurate data collection to perform the processes in the right way, not to mention that the proper interpretation of the data is also a challenge and requires a deep understanding of the context that is being used.
